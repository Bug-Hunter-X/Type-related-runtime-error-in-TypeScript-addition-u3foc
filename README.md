This repository demonstrates a subtle type-related bug in TypeScript. The `add` function is declared to take two numbers as input and return their sum. However, the code calls the function with a string and a number. Although TypeScript will not detect this error during compilation, running the code will throw a runtime exception. The solution shows how to enhance type checking and prevent this error.
